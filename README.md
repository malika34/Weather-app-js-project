# Weather App

A simple, responsive weather application built with **vanilla JavaScript**, HTML, and CSS.  
This project fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the current weather, detailed statistics, and a 5-slot weather forecast for the selected city.

## 🎨 Design to Code Conversion

This entire project is a result of **converting a Figma design into fully functional code**.  
I meticulously translated the Figma UI/UX design into semantic HTML, styled it with CSS, and powered its dynamic behavior with JavaScript by integrating real-time API data.

- Every pixel and layout detail was matched to the original Figma design.
- Responsive and accessible UI ensuring smooth user experience.
- Careful attention to visual consistency, typography, colors, and icons as per the design spec.

This hands-on experience improved my skills in:

- Interpreting design mockups and wireframes.
- Translating visual elements into clean, maintainable code.
- Connecting front-end with real-time external data sources via API.
- Managing time zones, date formats, and live updating clocks accurately.

## 🔐 Note on API Key

- The OpenWeatherMap API key is currently embedded directly in the JavaScript for simplicity.
- For production projects, it's recommended to secure the API key using environment variables and backend proxy to avoid exposing it publicly.

## 🙌 Acknowledgments

- Design originally created in **Figma**, and fully converted to code from scratch by me.
- Thanks to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) for their comprehensive weather API.
